"Your company built a TensorFlow neutral-network model with a large number of neurons and layers. The model fits well for the training data. However, when tested against new data, it performs poorly. What method can you employ to address this?", "Dropout Methods", "Threading", "Serialization", "Dropout Methods", "Dimensionality Reduction",
"You are building a model to make clothing recommendations. You know a user's fashion preference is likely to change over time, so you build a data pipeline to stream new data back to the model as it becomes available. How should you use this data to train the model?", "Continuously retrain the model on a combination of existing data and the new data.", "Continuously retrain the model on just the new data.", "Continuously retrain the model on a combination of existing data and the new data.", "Train on the existing data while using the new data as your test set.", "Train on the new data while using the existing data as your test set."
