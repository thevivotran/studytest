in the flashcard_app folder, there is an app that has been developed through the idea/*/PLAN.md

i want to 4 more new feature for my flashcard app:

1. a new "Review" feature for each dataset, user will see a Review button at each dataset line
2. a new "Review" button for each card, if a card is marked as Review. Then, once user choose a Review feature from choosing dataset step, user will go through a flashcard feature, but just contains Review questions
3. in a flashcard page, the answer should be listed out as A B C D or E, not 1 2 3 4 or 5 like current version
4. the answer should be shuffled, not show fixed order like current version
